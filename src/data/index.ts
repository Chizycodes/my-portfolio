	about: [
		`Hi, Iâ€™m Joy Okwudire â€” a software developer with over four years of experience building web and mobile applications. I enjoy turning ideas into useful, user-friendly products through clean, efficient code. My experience covers a range of projects, from e-commerce platforms to ERP systems, where Iâ€™ve focused on creating smooth and responsive user interfaces.`,

		`I specialize in frontend development using tools like React.js, React Native, Next.js and Vue.js, but I also have working knowledge of backend technologies like Node.js, Express and MongoDB, which allows me to understand and contribute to full-stack workflows when needed. Iâ€™ve collaborated with cross-functional teams to build reusable components, optimize performance, and integrate APIs â€” delivering complete, user-ready features.`,

		`Iâ€™m comfortable working in agile teams and enjoy learning from every project I take on. Iâ€™m also a certified AWS Cloud Practitioner, and Iâ€™m always open to learning new technologies and growing as a developer.`,

		`When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a good book. Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects. If youâ€™re interested in working together or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out!`,
